# 🚀 JavaScript Core Concepts

Welcome to the **JavaScript Core Concepts** section! This is your go-to guide for understanding key JavaScript concepts. This file is meant to grow with time, so feel free to add more concepts as you learn. 

## 📜 Topics Covered

### 🌍 Scope
- **Block Scope**: `{}`  
  Variables declared with `let` and `const` are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are defined in.
  ```bash
  {
      let blockVariable = "I'm block scoped!";
      const anotherBlockVariable = "Me too!";
      console.log(blockVariable); // ✅ Works!
  }
  console.log(blockVariable); // ❌ ReferenceError
    ```

  - **Global Scope**: `var`
    Variables declared with var have global or function scope and can lead to pollution of the global namespace.

    ```bash
    var globalVariable = "I'm globally accessible!";
    console.log(globalVariable); // ✅ Works anywhere!
    ```

   ### ✨ IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
   IIFEs are functions that execute immediately after they are defined. They help to prevent global scope pollution by encapsulating variables.
    ```bash
   (function() {
    let privateVariable = "I live in an IIFE!";
    console.log(privateVariable); // ✅ Accessible inside
    })();
    console.log(privateVariable); // ❌ ReferenceError
    ```
